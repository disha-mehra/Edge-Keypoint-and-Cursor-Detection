# Edge-Keypoint-and-Cursor-Detection
Performing Edge Detection and Keypoint Detection using own convolution code. Performing Cursor Detection.

### Overview
1. Edge Detection
   * Detect edges along both x and y directions using Sobel operator using own convolution code.
   
2. Keypoint Detection
   * Detect Keypoints in an image using Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)
   
3. Cursor Detection
   * For the task of cursor detection, which aims to locate the cursor in an image, two sets of images and cursor templates, named as "Set A" and "Set B", will be provided to you. Set A is composed of a total number of 25 images and 1 cursor template. Set A is for task 1., i.e., the basic cursor detection which contributes to 5 points. Set B is composed of a total number of 30 images and 3 different cursor template. Set B is for task 2., i.e., which contributes to 3 bonus points.
   1. Detect cursors in Set A.
   2. Detect cursors in Set B, which is more challenging.
